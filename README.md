# DandDOntology

This is an ontology for a graduate-level data management course about Dungeons and Dragons. It is based on the Player's Handbook for the 5th edition of the game.
The ontology does not include spells or adventuring equipment.
It is primarily designed for the creation of characters at a basic level and to illustrate armour and weapons options within the game.
